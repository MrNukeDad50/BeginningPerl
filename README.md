# BeginningPerl
Exercises for Learning Perl via Beginning Perl online book

## Lesson 0: Setup
The purpose of this is to prepare for working through the Begining Perl online book
I want to setup a GitHub repsitory and make sure i can do the basic changes 
on the main branch, then make a new branch.
I also want to do this on two platforms so i can get used to using it
in multiple locations and manage the code.
Lastly, I want to establish a template for 
working through the Beginning Perl Lessons.
